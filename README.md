A magic square of order n is an arrangement of n2 numbers, usually distinct integers, in a square, such that the n numbers in all rows, all columns, and both diagonals sum to the same constant. A magic square contains the integers from 1 to n2.
This is done for only odd numbers here.

sample test case:
magic square of 3:
      8 1 6
      3 5 7
      4 9 2
magic square of 5:
      17 24 1 8 15
      23 5 7 14 16
      4 6 13 20 22
      10 12 19 21 3
      11 18 25 2 9
